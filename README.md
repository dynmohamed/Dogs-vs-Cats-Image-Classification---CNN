# Dogs-vs-Cats-IOverview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging deep learning techniques to automate the classification of images, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in handling visual recognition tasks.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which contains 25,000 labeled images of dogs and cats. The images are split into training and testing sets.

Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

bash

Copy
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dogs-vs-cats-classification.git
cd dogs-vs-cats-classification
Prepare the dataset by downloading it from Kaggle and placing it in the designated folder within the project.
Run the training script:
bash

Copy
python train.py
After training, run the evaluation script to test the model:
bash

Copy
python evaluate.py
Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of the following layers:

Input layer: Accepts images of size (150, 150, 3)
Convolutional layers: Extracts features from the images
Pooling layers: Reduces dimensionality and retains important features
Fully connected layers: Classifies the images based on extracted features
Output layer: Produces the final classification (dog or cat)
Training
The model is trained using the following parameters:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy
Epochs: [Specify the number of epochs used]
Batch size: [Specify the batch size]
Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a separate test dataset, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy here]% on the test set. Visualizations of training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs can be found in the results folder.
